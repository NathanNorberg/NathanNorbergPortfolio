          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>As mentioned before one of my lifetime hobbies is building Legos. I also enjoy playing sports, videogames, hiking, traveling, and spending time with family and friends. I played almost every sport possible as a child but over the years I focused my time on soccer and played on club and school teams. As well as playing sports since a child I have also played videogames since a small child starting with Super Mario World on the SNES and continue to enjoy the fun and challenge they bring. One thing I have loved is traveling and was able to do a lot of it while being an employee of American Airlines.</p>

          <h2 class="white">My Travels</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="white">I had the opportunity to work for American Airlines as a ramp agent at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport for 2 years before starting the Web Development program at Galvanize. Working for the airline provided me the opportunity to travel around the world and visit different countries.  I loved learning about new cities, cultures and people during my travels as well as documenting as much as I could.  To the left are three videos I created from trips to <strong>(1)</strong> Barcelona, Spain <strong>(2)</strong> Kyoto and Tokyo, Japan <strong>(3)</strong> Bangkok, Phuket, and Krabi, Thailand & Singapore</p>

          <p class="white">My family (picture above on the right) is composed of my wife, parents, three sisters, and one brother in law.  I lived in Utah until I was 11 years old, then moved to Arizona and have been here ever since, with the exception of serving a 2 year church mission in Colombia.  Most of my inlaws (picture above in the top middle) are from Arizona as well. I am very close with my family and over the years I have received immense support from them in all I do.</p>

          <h2>Legos</h2>
          <p>As long as I can remember I have been building. My grandparents would always give me legos for any occasion and over the past 20+ years I have built up quite the collection. My biggest projects (on the right) are composed of several thousand pieces, took multiple weeks to complete and required meticulus attention to detail. I find great enjoyment to create something and see it brought to life before my eyes. The same satisfaction that I've felt over the years building legos I have found in web development.</p>
